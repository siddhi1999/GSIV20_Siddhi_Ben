# GSIV20_Siddhi_Ben

a. Instructions:

1. cd gsiv20_siddhi_ben-1
2. npm i
3. Create a secret.json file under the src folder
   Its content will be as described below:
   "{ "key": <Your api key> }"
4. npm start

b. Highlights:

1. Load more feature -> I have given feature that doesn't burden the user with having to navigate across a series of pages. Interestingly enough, because loading additional products requires an active choice and click, users tend to read displayed content more closely on websites.
2. API Key security -> I hide my API key by putting my json file in .gitignore file to make sure it doesn't get exposed and to protect critical assets, and prevent people I don't know from stealing things.
3. Search's Responsive Feature -> This feature highlights that there's no need to press "enter" after typing in search bar for the results. The more you type or change the name the results get updated.

c. Points I could have improved:

1. The styling could have been better. But I gave my best shot given the deadline. If I've got 4 more hours I would improve it.
